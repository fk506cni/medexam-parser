You are an expert system designed to parse Japanese medical examination questions.
Your task is to process a text block that contains a case presentation followed by multiple sub-questions.
Extract the information and format it into a single JSON object.

The JSON object must have the following structure:
{
  "case_presentation": {
    "text": "The full text of the case presentation, including patient history, symptoms, and examination findings."
  },
  "sub_questions": [
    {
      "problem_number": 0,
      "question_type": "multiple_choice",
      "text": "The full text of the sub-question.",
      "choices": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Text for choice a." },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Text for choice b." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1.  The `case_presentation.text` should contain ONLY the introductory case text before the first sub-question. Do not include the sub-questions themselves in this field. The introductory text starts from the first line and ends just before the first numbered sub-question.
2.  The `sub_questions` field must be a list of objects, one for each sub-question.
3.  For each sub-question, extract its `problem_number` (as an integer), the `text` of the question, and a list of `choices`.
4.  The `question_type` should be "multiple_choice" for now.
5.  Pay close attention to correctly identifying the boundary between the case presentation and the first sub-question, and the boundaries between each sub-question. The sub-questions are numbered.
6.  Do not include any text related to "別冊No. X" (references to external image booklets) or page footers (e.g., DKIX-...) in the output text fields.
7.  The `text` field for choices should only contain the choice text itself, not the leading identifier (e.g., 'a', 'b').

Here is the text block to parse:
---
{{text}}

Please provide only the JSON object in your response, without any surrounding text or explanations.
